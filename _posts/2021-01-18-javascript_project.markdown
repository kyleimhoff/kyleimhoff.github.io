For my JS project I chose to make a SPA storefront. After completing the bootcamp I plan on doing some freelancing on the size to potentially grow my own business. So I figured making storefronts would be good practice. When you start up the webserver and open index.html you are greeted by a navbar at the top and if you scroll down the js renders the items gathered from a fetch request that are seeded into the database.

The cart was my biggest challenge to code. It is hidden by defaul when the dom loads and pops up when somthing is added to the cart. Inside the cart there is a list of items with a remove button to delete the item from the cart. There is a dynamic quantity  on the right had side with chevrons above and below that alter the quantity of the item and the total price at the bottom. As well as a button at the bottom of the cart to clear everything.

I plan to continue to work and update this project with more functionality.

I had previously neglected studying css in any depth before this project. I have recently watched many videos on css and found a particular video that I based my css off of since I liked the design so much. I was not expecting to enjoy front end development as much as I did. It is very refreshing to have a more creative input into a project than writing procedural code.

This project required much more research to get the desired functionality than I expected. The coursework did a good job teaching the basics of js but to comlete this project I had to dive in alot deeper. I still feel like there is a ton to learn about javascript and I have already purchased a few books and saved a few playlists on youtube to start diving deeper into js.

I realized that I had alot more to learn about github this project. While working on my project I was mainly working in the terminal in my backend. I failed to realize that I was only commiting my backend and none of my html, css, or js was getting pushed to github. I tried to figure out how to expand my repository to include my front end files. In the end I ended up messing up that repository so I had to delete it and reupload the project in a new repository.
