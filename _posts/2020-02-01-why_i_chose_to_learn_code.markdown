I am currently a contract lab tech at a manufacturing plant in microbiology. There isn't very many opportunities for me to get a full time position in my field where I live besides where I work. But they are currently doing cuts so there is no hiring going on. I have always loved to make things. Whether it be art or tinkering with electronics. One of my friends went into game development and wanted me to work on a project with him making the 3D models for a game he was producing and he also reccomended that I try learning to code. I found that coding is alot like tinkering just on a computer. You get to make some pretty awesome applications for whatever you can think of. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and starting a new career path with what I have been and a will be learning.
