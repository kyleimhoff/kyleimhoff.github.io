"# My CLI Project"
For my CLI project I chose to work with the Lord of the Rings API which can be found at https://the-one-api.herokuapp.com/. This API has a huge database of knowledge that it stores data on the books, movies, characters, ect. I did require a key to access most of the API. That was the first hurdle I had to jump through. After an exhaustive google search I finally learned how to pass my key into an authentication header.

Once I had access to the information I needed to parse the data to give me a list of what I wanted without all of the extra fluff. I accomplished this with the use of .map to give me an array of titles.

 I then created a cli controller using a case method on a users input to determine what data was given. The user is asked to type books or movies and the program prints a list of the books or movies into the terminal then asks for another input. 

This was a fun project that taught me alot about the use of APIâ€™s, pushing my project to github, creating ruby gems, and so much more. I really enjoyed the process of using our knowledge of Ruby and making something that is usable and practical.
